# Netflix Clone (react native app)
This project is mobile cross-platform application based on netflix developed by **[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)** library and **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** language. The application replicates a basic app functionality without advanced playback features. This project is created based on design on [dribble platform](https://dribbble.com/shots/10070781-Netflix-Mobile-App-Redesign/attachments/2088191?mode=media).
